# Blog Front End

## Overview

Front end for blog.

## Learnings

Learnings from my first fullstack project:

1. JWT storage is a hotly debated topic. Ultimately I just settled on saving it in localStorage.
2. First time calling fetch requests with POST methods.
3. Using context to store user state.
4. Conditional rendering based on user state.
